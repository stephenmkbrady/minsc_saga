# Matrix Integration Dashboard (Minsc Saga)

This repository contains the `Matrix Integration Dashboard` project, a proof-of-concept React frontend application designed to display and interact with Matrix chat messages and media. It connects to an external API (like the `Boo Memories` API) to fetch and present chat data, offering features like message search, filtering, and media previews.

**Note:** This project is currently a development proof of concept and is not production-ready.

## Features

*   **Message Display:** Fetches and displays Matrix chat messages.
*   **Media Previews:** Supports inline previews for images, videos, and audio files.
*   **Search and Filtering:** Allows searching messages by content, sender, and filtering by date range, message type, sender, and media presence/size.
*   **Dark Mode:** User-toggleable dark/light theme.
*   **Matrix Widget Integration:** Designed to be embedded as a widget within a Matrix client, automatically authenticating and fetching data for the current room.
*   **API Integration:** Connects to a backend API for data retrieval and media downloads.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/stephenmkbrady/minsc_saga.git
    cd minsc_saga
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `minsc_saga/` directory with your environment variables.

**Required:**

*   `REACT_APP_DATABASE_API_BASE_URL`: The base URL of your `Boo Memories` API (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
*   `REACT_APP_DATABASE_API_KEY`: The API key for authenticating with your `Boo Memories` API.

Example `.env`:

```
REACT_APP_DATABASE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
REACT_APP_DATABASE_API_KEY="your_boo_memories_api_key"
```

### Running the Application

To run the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Matrix Widget Integration

This dashboard is designed to be embedded as a Matrix widget. To add it to a Matrix room:

1.  Ensure your `Boo Memories` API is running and accessible from where your Matrix client is running.
2.  In your Matrix client, type the following command in the desired room:

    ```
    /addwidget <YOUR_DASHBOARD_URL>?matrix_user_id=$matrix_user_id&matrix_room_id=$matrix_room_id
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_DASHBOARD_URL>` with the URL where your React application is hosted (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` if running locally).

    Example:
    ```
    /addwidget http://localhost:3000?matrix_user_id=$matrix_user_id&matrix_room_id=$matrix_room_id
    ```
